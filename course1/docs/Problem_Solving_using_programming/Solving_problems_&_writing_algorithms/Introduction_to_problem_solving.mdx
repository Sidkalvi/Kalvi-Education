# Introduction to Problem Solving
			
## Lesson Objective: 
	In this lesson you will learn how Programming is primarily a problem-solving skill and explore some real-world problems that are solved through programming. This is a live class and a warm welcome to the class on Problem solving. You will find more exciting things in this lesson. Happy learning!!

## Why is Problem solving important?
	Solving problems means making choices. Typically, effective problem-solving skills result in “happier, more confident, and more independent” individuals. This skill builds confidence in you and helps you make better decisions.	
## Reading content on the topic:
You are here because you chose engineering as your career choice, you must question yourself why the world needs engineers. 
Engineers are needed to solve the world’s problems(from a bridge for crossing a water body to computers for processing data)
In the last 2 decades, computer hardware got less expensive and the Internet opened the gates for many advanced technologies
The job of a ‘software’ engineer is to solve problems by building software using various technologies that have evolved over the years.
