Welcome to the lesson on Front-end web development. This would be a **self-paced class** which focuses on one of the fundamental topics in HTML - Text Fundamentals. Please make sure that you are completing the entire lesson.

# HTML Text Fundamentals

## What are HTML Text Fundamentals?

One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning so that a browser can display it correctly. This lesson helps you to understand the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.

## Why should we learn HTML Text Fundamentals?

Let us look at two versions of a webpage to understand the reason why we should learn HTML Text Fundamentals.

[Version 1:](https://ramkumar-anandan.github.io/FEWD1104-boilerplate/)

[Version 2:](https://ramkumar-anandan.github.io/FEWD1104-final/)

When you open the version 1 webpage in your browser, you'll see that the text appears as a big chunk! That’s because there is no structure to the page. On the other hand version 2 webpage is a well-structured webpage.

Structuring the web page has a lot of other benefits as well.

They are:

1. **Attracts users**

   Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content, often just reading the headings, to begin with. If they can't see anything useful within a few seconds, they'll likely leave the page.

2. **Helps in SEO**

   Search engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings. Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

3. **Helps visually impaired people**

   Visually impaired people often don't read web pages; they listen to them instead. This is done with software called a screen reader. This software provides ways to get fast access to given text content. Among the various techniques used, they provide an outline of the document by reading out the headings, allowing their users to find the information they need quickly. If headings are not available, they will be forced to listen to the whole document read out loud.

4. **For styling & scripting**

   To style content with CSS, or make it do interesting things with JavaScript, you need to have elements wrapping the relevant content, so CSS/JavaScript can effectively target it.

Now that we have established the need for structuring, let’s dive deep into how to do that.

## Headings and paragraphs in HTML:

The most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.

Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.

### Heading

A heading tag is used to define the headings of a webpage. There are six headings elements they are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. h1 is the highest in level and h6 is the least in level.

Here are some useful links on how to create headings..

### Paragraph

The paragraph element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers in default add some white space before and after a paragraph.

## HTML List:

![Lists](https://media.giphy.com/media/B7o99rIuystY4/giphy.gif)

Lists are everywhere in life, from your shopping list to the list of directions you subconsciously follow to get to your house every day! Lists are everywhere on the web too. Here are a few resources on how to create lists.

## Emphasis and importance in HTML

When we want to add emphasis to spoken language, we stress certain words, subtly altering the meaning of what we are saying. Similarly, in written language, we tend to stress words by putting them in italics, similarly, in HTML we use the &lt;em> (emphasis) element to mark up such instances.

# Instructions for the exercise

And voila, that’s the end of all the concepts in this lesson. Now, time for an exercise!

**Required links**

Boilerplate link: [Dalgona coffee recepie exercise boilerplate link](https://codepen.io/ProGrad-Junior/pen/PoRoPeb)

**How to work with exercise**

Every exercise will have n number of iterations. You are expected to complete the iterations in increasing order.

For example, you will have to complete the first iteration before starting the second iteration, and so on.

You can find the instructions for completing the iterations here below as well as in the boilerplate file in which you will be working as comments.

**Iteration-wise instructions**

**Note:** Iteration 5 is mentioned in multiple places.

**Iteration 6:** Use an appropriate tag to underline the word "tbsp"

**Description:** In the boilerplate code the word “tbsp” is not marked up, using the knowledge that you have got from the HTML text fundamentals lesson try marking up the word “tbsp” so that it gets an underline.
